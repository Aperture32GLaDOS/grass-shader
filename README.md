### A godot project using GPU instancing and compute shaders to draw over a million blades of grass at relatively high performance

Notable features:
- Custom grass blade model with 11 vertices and 5 faces
- A compute shader to instantiate the instances of the grass blades, including random tallness and slightly randomized positions
- Tasteful post-processing, using a combination of sharpening and fog
